# Combination of trended and seasonal effects
# The ACF values decrease gradually with increasing lag, the series has a long-term autocorrelation structure.
#There are significant positive correlations for almost all the lags within the 50-lag window, 
# suggesting the series has a persistent structure or trend.
# The slow decay of the ACF indicates a trend in the data,
# The absence of regular sharp spikes at specific lags suggests that any seasonality in the data is not strong or is overshadowed by the trend
# Statistically significant exceeds the blue dashed bars
ggAcf(daily_max_delay_ts, lag=50)
# Hige autocorelation into the data
# The time series is not stationnary


# The differenced series oscillates around zero
# Some spikes (e.g., around time point 5)
autoplot(diff(daily_max_delay_ts)) 
# decreases gradually over many lags, showing a long-term dependence in the series.
# We can still see that we have less variation during the year 2
# significant autocorrelation (bars outside the blue)
# This indicates that values in the time series are correlated with their past values 
# over extended periods, further confirming non-stationarity
# the differenced series appears stationary, good
ggAcf(diff(daily_max_delay_ts))

# From the plot, most autocorrelations are within the blue confidence bands, which suggests the differenced series is likely stationary.
